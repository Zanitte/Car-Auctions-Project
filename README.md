# Car-Auctions-Project

This project uses PySide6 and mysql-connector-python, both are required in order to run it, along the local database for which I have provided the sql query that will create what is needed, mysql workbench is recommended for this operation. The sql query can be found in the database file.

A selection of screenshots from the app can be found in the app_showcase file.
